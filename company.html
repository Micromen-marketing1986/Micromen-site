      <div class="subheading">Our Journey</div>
      <h2>Company History</h2>
      <p>
        Micromen began its journey in 1986 as a partnership firm founded by a group of technocrats who were
        early pioneers in customized business software in India. In the early years, the company served multiple
        industries, providing tailored solutions for manufacturing, trading, finance, and construction companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1995, Micromen evolved into a Private Limited Company, marking a major shift in growth strategy and
        operational vision. With rapid expansion through channel partnerships and a sharpened focus on product
        innovation, the company established itself as a trusted technology partner across regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the construction sector grew in scale and complexity, Micromen made a strategic decision to focus
        exclusively on this domain. This led to the creation of
        <span class="highlight">BuildSuperfast ERP</span>, a comprehensive and deeply specialized solution designed
        to address the end-to-end needs of builders, developers, and contractors. The product quickly became the
        company’s flagship offering, widely recognized by clients as
        <span class="highlight">one of the most powerful and reliable construction &amp; real-estate ERPs in the industry</span>.
